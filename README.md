## AIM:
To assemble the computer system

## STEPS:
### Step 1: Open The Case 
### Step 2: Install The Power Supply 
### Step 3: Attach The Components To Motherboard
### Step 4: Install motherboard 
### Step 5: Install internal drives

## Step 6: Connect all internal cables
Power Cables Are Used To Distribute Electricity From the Power Supply To The Motherboard And Other Components. Data Cables transmit Data Between The Motherboard And Storage Devices, Such As Hard Drives.
